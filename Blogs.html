									   <p>ETERNITY

Have you ever sat down and think about the word “ETERNITY”? 

Eternity is an unending time, it is forever, an experience not bounded by time.

Know this, eternity is certain and you must spend it somewhere.It is either you spend your eternity in heaven or hell.<img src="./img/eternity.jpg" alt="can't-display" style="width:170px; height: 170px; margin-left:15px; float: right;">


Some people think after death, all is finished. NO!!! THERE IS LIFE AFTER DEATH.

Eternity comes immediately after death and that is why this question is coming to you today:

"WHERE WILL YOU SPEND ETERNITY?" if you die now? Will you spend it in heaven or hell?

Some people keep asking wanting to know the exact location of heaven and hell.<br>

Dear friend, the exact location is not a question we(<--insert modal button here--!>)(<-- and then the box containing the remainder of the story--!>h) need to concentrate on. Let's leave the location and look into this; 

Heaven is an holy place, it is a place filled with peace, love and happiness while hell is a place of torment.

God gave every man a gift and it is the gift of choice.You are not going to spend your eternity in heaven because your parents are born again, where you are going to spend your eternity depends on the choice you make today.
<br>
If you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour you will spend eternity with Him,

If you reject Jesus Christ you will spend eternity away from Him.

The book of John 3:36 says that " He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him".

In Mark 8:36-37, the Bible says that;
"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"

What shall it profit you if when you spend all your days on this earth without God and you spend eternity in hell? 

Your soul is the most valuable possession in the entire world. What is your profit when your soul is dying and your flesh is enjoying the pleasure and things of this world?


The question is, are you living with eternity in view? 
Are you living as though Christ could come today? Having a proper view of eternity will drastically affect how you live.

How sad it is to face death without you having God. 
How sad it is to face God with your garment soiled with sin and be doomed forever.

For it is appointed unto man ONCE TO DIE,but after this JUDGEMENT.
Do you want to die without Christ and go to hell?

Are you still struggling with that secret sin?
Are you not tired of those dirty lifestyles of yours?
Why not run to Jesus today? He is ready to save you He died on the cross so that we can spend eternity in heaven.


Remember, no man can see the kingdom of God except he/she is born again.

HEAVEN IS REAL! HELL IS REAL! 
The choice is in your hand.

THIS QUESTION COMES TO YOU TODAY;

ETERNITY! ETERNITY!
WHERE WILL YOU SPEND ETERNITY?
